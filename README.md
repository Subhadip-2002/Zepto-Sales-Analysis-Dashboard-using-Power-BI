I developed a Zepto Sales Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to analyze  sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The dashboard provides insights through various KPIs, including total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and customer ratings. Key visualizations like Donut Charts, Bar Charts, and Funnel Maps highlight trends such as the impact of fat content on sales and the geographic distribution of sales across outlets. By leveraging DAX calculations and data modeling, the dashboard offers a comprehensive view, helping drive data-driven decision-making and optimization strategies.
